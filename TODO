* doxygen does not see some of the references 
    (http://siekiera.mimuw.edu.pl/~paal/stein.html -> paal::data_structures::Voronoi. ) 
* alternative kanpsack algorithm (n*(1/epsilon)^2)
* make better traits, maybe it supposed to look like std::iterator traits

* ITERATIVE ROUNDING
** primal/dual simplex (and other glpk settings?)
** framework documentation
** there is some common code in the steiner network and DBMST
** remove some debug output
** columns iterator is invalidated when we remove column (see relaxing code)
** cost function
** complexities
** removing rows/cols strategy
** resolving, solution by moving a point ?
** cplex support ???

* GREEDY
** set cover (AA)
** max coverage (AA)
** knapsack (Piotr W.)
** Scheduling jobs on identical parallel machines (tDoAA) 
** scheduling jobs with deadlines on a single machine (tDoAA)
** k-center
** the multiway cut
** the k multi way cut
** steiner forest (conjecture) (Piotr W.)
