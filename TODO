* check existing algorithms on more sophisticated metrics (e.g. metric that take nonintegral)
* doxygen does not see some of the references 
    (http://siekiera.mimuw.edu.pl/~paal/stein.html -> paal::data_structures::Voronoi. ) 
* set up jenkins (run automatic tests, tests different builds and compilers)
* alternative kanpsack algorithm (n*(1/epsilon)^2)
* make better traits, maybe it supposed to look like std::iterator traits

* ITERATIVE ROUNDING
** fix row generation
** framework documentation
** tree_augmentation example
** there is some common code in the steiner network and DBMST
** primal/dual simplex (and other glpk settings?)
** remove some debug output
** columns iterator is invalidated when we remove column (see relaxing code)
** LP formulation in separate deal
** cost function
** complexities
** removing rows/cols strategy
** resolving, solution by moving a point ?
** cplex support ???

* GREEDY
** set cover (AA)
** max coverage (AA)
** k-center
** the multiway cut
** the k multi way cut
** steiner forest (conjecture) (Piotr W.)
