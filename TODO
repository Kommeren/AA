* disable typedefs warning in doxygen
* knapsack (not 0/1) fptas is not realy fptas
* doxygen does not see some of the references
    (http://siekiera.mimuw.edu.pl/~paal/stein.html -> paal::data_structures::Voronoi.)
* alternative kanpsack algorithm (n*(1/epsilon)^2)
* make better traits, maybe it supposed to look like std::iterator traits

* ITERATIVE ROUNDING
** rethink rounding
** limited number of relaxation per iteration (at least in BDMST, maybe in the rest also)?
** LP formulation in separate dir
** framework documentation
** restriction(v, v) case in steiner network
** complexities
** improve row generation ?
** resolving solution by moving a point ?
** cplex support ???
** steiner tree doxygen warnings

* GREEDY
** set cover (AA)
** max coverage (AA)
** steiner forest (conjecture)
