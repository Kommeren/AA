* components to sum te updates values in LS
* add complexities
* make better traits, maybe it supposed to look like std::iterator traits

* ITERATIVE ROUNDING
** resolve BDMST problems
** there is some common code in the steiner network and DBMST
** framework documentation
** remove some debug output
** columns iterator is invalidated when we remove column (see rounding code)
** cost function
** removing rows/cols strategy
** resolving, solution by moving a point
** cplex support ???

* GREEDY
** set cover (AA)
** max coverage (AA)
** knapsack
** Scheduling jobs on identical parallel machines (tDoAA) 
** scheduling jobs with deadlines on a single machine (tDoAA)
** k-center
** the multiway cut
** the k multi way cut
** shortest superstring (conjecture)
** steiner forest (conjecture)
