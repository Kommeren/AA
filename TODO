* disable typedefs warning in doxygen
* knapsack (not 0/1) fptas is not realy fptas
* doxygen does not see some of the references
    (http://siekiera.mimuw.edu.pl/~paal/stein.html -> paal::data_structures::Voronoi.)
* alternative kanpsack algorithm (n*(1/epsilon)^2)
* make better traits, maybe it supposed to look like std::iterator traits

* ITERATIVE ROUNDING
** rethink rounding
** columns iterator is invalidated when we remove column
** limited number of relaxation per iteration (at least in BDMST, maybe in the rest also)?
** there is some common code in the steiner network and DBMST (and steiner tree) oracles
** LP formulation in separate dir
** framework documentation
** doxygen warnings
** restriction(v, v) case in steiner network
** resolve and stop_condition components in IR
** BDMST oracle initial test
** improve row generation
** cost function
** complexities
** removing rows/cols strategy
** resolving solution by moving a point ?
** cplex support ???

* GREEDY
** set cover (AA)
** max coverage (AA)
** k-center
** steiner forest (conjecture)
