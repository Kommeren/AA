* disable typedefs warning in doxygen
* knapsack unbounded fptas is not realy fptas
  there is a problem with number of objects. 
  The number of objects is included in the multiplier. 
  In the current version we use incorrect number of items.
  One of the solution could be to group the small eelements in the bigger bundles.
* doxygen does not see some of the references
    (http://siekiera.mimuw.edu.pl/~paal/stein.html -> paal::data_structures::Voronoi.)
* alternative kanpsack algorithm (n*(1/epsilon)^2)
* make better traits, maybe it supposed to look like std::iterator traits
* function comparing 2 metrics

* ITERATIVE ROUNDING
** error checking for generalized assignment
** move and copy constructor in glp class
** glp.get_columns() returns columns in random order
** LP formulation in separate dir
** improve row generation ?
** resolving solution by moving a point ?
** cplex support ???

*lp
** (glpk) in the resolve we don't allways want to call
   glp_adv_basis, but run it only when glp_simplex fails.
   This is not done beacause of the bug in the glpk.
   It should be done when the bug is fixed.

* GREEDY
** set cover (AA)
** max coverage (AA)
** steiner forest (conjecture)

*LOCAL_SEARCH
** maybe 0 shouldn't be hardcoded
