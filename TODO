* disable typedefs warning in doxygen
* knapsack (not 0/1) fptas is not realy fptas
* doxygen does not see some of the references
    (http://siekiera.mimuw.edu.pl/~paal/stein.html -> paal::data_structures::Voronoi.)
* alternative kanpsack algorithm (n*(1/epsilon)^2)
* make better traits, maybe it supposed to look like std::iterator traits

* ITERATIVE ROUNDING
** error checking for generalized assignment
** move and copy constructor in glp class
** glp.get_columns() zwraca kolumny w odwrotnej kolejnosci
** LP formulation in separate dir
** improve row generation ?
** resolving solution by moving a point ?
** cplex support ???
** steiner tree doxygen warnings

*lp
** (glpk) in the resolve we don't allways want to call 
   glp_adv_basis, but run it only when glp_simplex fails.
   This is not done beacause of the bug in the glpk. 
   It should be done when the bug is fixed.
  

* GREEDY
** set cover (AA)
** max coverage (AA)
** steiner forest (conjecture)

*LOCAL_SEARCH
** maybe 0 shouldnt be hardcoded
