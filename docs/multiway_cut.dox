\section def Problem definition.
In Multiway Cut problem we have graph G and sets of k terminals.
The goal is to find minimum cost set of edges whose removal disconnects each pair of terminals.

\section Solution

We put terminals in k dimensional space, with Manhattan metric,
i-th terminal in point 0, 0, 0, ... 0, 0, 1(i-th position), 0, 0, ... 0, 0.
All others vertices have sum of coordinates equal 1.
We minimise sum for each edge: edge cost multiply by edge length in Manhattan metric 
We solve lp to find the location of the others vertices.

Then we several times randomly chose radius from each terminal,
and we put each vertex in components, correspond to the first terminal, whose ball contains that vertex.
We select cheapest solution, from all randomly chosen.

Expected Approximation Ratio equals 2, what is the reason to choose rays many times

\subsection com_multiway_cut The complexity

Complexity of the algorithm is \f$O(|LP|+|R|*(|E|+|V|*|K|))\f$ where \a R is number of repeats \a K is number of terminals,  \a V is number of vertices \a E is number of edges
and \a LP is cost of solve LP by simplex
\subsection mem_multiway_cut The memory
Memory complexity of the algorithm is \f$O(|LP|+|K|*(|V|+|E|))\f$ where \a K is number of terminals  \a V is number of vertices, \a E is number of edges and \a LP is memory cost of solve LP by simplex
