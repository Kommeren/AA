<h3> PRELIMINARIES </h3>
Let us consider maximization problem	: <br><br>

max f(x) over x in X. <br><br>

A well known heuristic for solving problem formulated in such a way is the local search(LS). <br>
Assume that we have feasible solution x' in X. <br>
The LS algorithm searches the neighborhood N(x') of x' and tries to localize the better solution x'' with f(x'') > f(x'). <br>
If the better solution is found we set x' equal x'' and rerun previous step. <br>
If better solution couldn't be found we finish the search with resulting local optimum x*. <br><br>

This algorithm can be repeated and the best local optimum is presented. <br><br>

Let us write the pseudo code for this operation:  <br><br>

<font size=4>
<pre>
 local_search() 
 {
     x -> random_solution(X)  
     for_each(Update u in N(x)) 
     { 
         if(gain(apply u on x) > 0) 
         {
             x -> apply u on x 
         }	
     }
     return x
 }
</pre>
</font>

Note that we are working on updates (not on the full solution). This idea is going to be used in the c++ code. <br> 
The reason of this is the fact that usually the updates are much lighter than the full solutions. <br>
<br>
Note that in many cases, eg. k-local search or facility location, our solution is  the collection of the elements.<br>
In many cases for such solutions we search the neighborhood of each solution element and try to improve it by changing some part of the solution near the chosen solution element. <br>
<br>
In this cases it is more convenient to proceed in the following way:<br>

<font size=4>
<pre>
 local_search() 
 {
     x -> random_solution(X) 
     for_each(Element e of x)
     {
      for_each(Update u in N(e)) 
      { 
         if(gain(apply u on x) > 0) 
         {
             x -> apply u on x 
         }	
      }
     }
     return x
 }
</pre>
</font>
<br>
We find this algorithm schema  extremely useful in our implementation! <br>
We will refer to this schema as LocalSearchMultiSolution. <br>
Also if necessary we will refer to the "normal" LS as LocalSearchSingleSolution.

<h3> LOCAL SEARCH INTERFACE </h3>
<h4> LOCAL SEARCH SINGLE SOLUTION </h4>

In order to present the LS interface we need to introduce several concepts.<br>
Note that <i>Solution</i> is the solution type and <i>Update</i> is the type of single update. <br>
<i>UpdateIteratorsRange</i> is assumed to be std::pair of iterators, pointing to the begin and end of the updates collection. <br><br>

Concepts:
<ol>
    <li> <i>NeighborhoodGetter</i>  is a concept class responsible for getting the neighborhood of the current solution  
    <pre>
    NeighborhoodGetterArchetype {
        UpdateIteratorsRange get(Solution & s)
    }
    </pre>
    <li> <i>ImproveChecker</i> is a concept class responsible for checking if the specific update element improve the solution.
    <pre>
    ImproveCheckerArchetype {
        int gain(Solution & s, const Update & update);
    }
    </pre>
    <li> <i>SolutionUpdater</i> is a concept class responsible for updating the solution with the Update.
    <pre>
    SolutionUdaterArchetype {
        int update(Solution & s, const Update & update);
    }
    </pre>

</ol>


Now we present the interface of the LS algorithm

<font size=4>
<pre>

template &lttypename Solution, 
          typename NeighborhoodGetter, 
          typename ImproveChecker, 
          typename SolutionUpdater, 
          typename SearchStrategy = search_startegies::ChooseFirstBetter> 
                        // Search strategy, descibes LS search strategy. For ow we are planning two strategies:
                        // ChooseFirstBetter -> The algorithm chooses the first update with the positive gain
                        // SteepestSlope     -> The algorithm chooses the update with the largest gain and update if positive.
          //note there is no Update here because it can be deduced    <font color="red"> maybe it should be contained... </font>
class LocalSearchStep { // <font color="red"> now we present only one step of the algorithm, later on we plan to add one more layer </font> 
public:
   LocalSearchStep(Solution solution, 
                   NeighborhoodGetter ng, 
                   ImproveChecker check, 
                   SolutionUpdater solutionUpdater); 
    
    bool search(); // performing one step of the search
    Solution & getSolution();
};

</pre>
</font>
<br>



<h4> LOCAL SEARCH MULTI SOLUTION </h4>

The interface and conceptes of the  LocalSearchMultiSolution are ver simmilar to the LocalSearchSingleSolution ones.<br>


<br>
Note that <i>SolutionElement</i> is the type of the specific element of the solution. <br>
<i>SolutionElementIterator</i> is assumed to be the type of iterators over solution. <br><br>

Concepts:
<ol>
    <li> <i>MultiSolution</i>  is a concept class representing the  solution  
    <pre>
    MultiSolutionArchetype {
        SolutionElementIterator begin();
        SolutionElementIterator end();
        InnerSolution get(); // OPTIONAL, very often solution concept is just adapter containing real solution
    }
    <li> <i>MultiNeighborhoodGetter</i>  is a concept class responisble for getting the neighborhood of the current solution  
    <pre>
    MultiNeighborhoodGetterArchetype {
        UpdateIteratorsRange get(Solution & s, const SolutionElement &)
    }
    </pre>
    <li> <i>MultiImproveChecker</i> is a concept class responsible for checking if the specific update element improve the solution.
    <pre>
    MultiImproveCheckerArchetype {
        int gain(Solution & s, const SolutionElement &, const Update & update);
    }
    </pre>
    <li> <i>MultiSolutionUpdater</i> is a concept class responsible for updating the solution with the Update.
    <pre>
    MultiSolutionUdaterArchetype {
        int update(Solution & s, const SolutionElement &, const Update & update);
    }
    </pre>

</ol>


Now we present the interface of the LSMultiSolution algorithm

<font size=4>
<pre>

template &lttypename MultiSolution, 
          typename MultiNeighborhoodGetter, 
          typename MultiImproveChecker, 
          typename MultiSolutionUpdater, 
          typename MultiSearchStrategy = search_startegies::ChooseFirstBetter> 
                        // Search strategy, describes LS search strategy. For now we are planning two strategies:
                        // ChooseFirstBetter -> The algorithm chooses the first update with the positive gain
                        // SteepestSlope     -> The algorithm chooses the update with the largest gain and update if positive.
          //note there is no Update and SolutionElement here because they can be deduced    <font color="red"> maybe it should be contained... </font>
class LocalSearchStepMultiSolution { // <font color="red"> now we present only one step of the algorithm, later on we plan to add one more layer </font> 
   
public:
   LocalSearchStep(MultiSolution solution, 
                   MultiNeighborhoodGetter ng, 
                   MultiImproveChecker check, 
                   MultiSolutionUpdater solutionUpdater); 
    
    bool search();// performing one step of the search
    InnerSolution & getSolution(); // is here only if MultiSolution has get member function.
};

</pre>
</font>
<br>


<h3> SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATIONS </h3>

Generally the library is divided into the three layers:

<pre>
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

    ALGORITHMS  - eg. LocalSearch. The algorithms are written in very general way. 
    The are delegating the specific tasks to the algorithm helpers.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

    ALGORITHMS  HELPERS - eg. NeighborhoodGetter, SolutionUpdater. 
    The algorithm helpers are working on specific data structures concepts. 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

    DATA_STRUCTURES - e.g. Metric, Cycle. The data structure used by algorithm helpers. 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre>
<br>
Our library is delivering default implementations of components from each layer. <br>
The strength of this design is that the user is allowed to change components from each layer. <br><br>

For example the user can easily swap the implementation of the NeighborhoodGetter to provide his own way of searching the neighborhood. <br>
Also note that the same algorithm helpers that are used by local search can be used to produced the simulated annealing algorithm. <br>
If the user want to swap implementation of the metric to use specific properties of his topology is not the problem at all! <br>




<h3> 2-opt FOR TSP </h3>

Now we can draw for you interface and the example implementation and usage of 2_local_search for TSP. <br><br>

In order to present 2-opt we need to introduce some concept and types. 

<ol>
<li> VertexType - denotes type of the TSP vertex.
<li> Metric need to have fulfill the interface: 
<pre>
    MetricArchetype {
        DistanceType operator()(VertexType,VertexType);
    }
</pre> 
</ol>

<li>  Cycle need to have fulfill the interface: 
<pre>
    CycleArchetype {
        void flip(VertexType,VertexType);
        EdgeIteratorRange getEdgesRange();
    }
</pre> 
</ol>

Now we can present implementattion of 2-local-search. <br>
Note that in the main algorithm we had to define only constructors.<br>
The rest is done by base class LocalSearchMultiSolution and the implemented helpers.

<font size=4>
<pre>
template &lttypename VertexType, 
           typename Metric, //<font color="red"> to consistent it should be the template as well </font>
           typename NeighborhoodGetter = TrivialNeigbourGetter,
           template <class> class ImproveChecker = ImproveChecker2Opt,
           template <class> class Cycle = data_structures::SimpleCycle>
 
          class  TwoLocalSearchStep : 
              public LocalSearchStepMultiSolution<TwoLocalSearchContainer<Cycle<VertexType>>, 
                         NeighborhoodGetter, ImproveChecker<Metric>, TwoLocalSearchUpdater >  {
 
                
                 typedef Cycle<VertexType> CycleT;
                 typedef LocalSearchStepMultiSolution<TwoLocalSearchContainer<CycleT> , NeighborhoodGetter, 
                     ImproveChecker<Metric>, TwoLocalSearchUpdater > LocalSearchStepT;
 
                 public:
 
                     template <typename SolutionIter>  
                      TwoLocalSearchStep(SolutionIter solBegin, SolutionIter solEnd, 
                                         Metric & m, 
                                         ImproveChecker<Metric> ich,
                                         NeighborhoodGetter ng = NeighborhoodGetter()
                                         ) 
 
                         : LocalSearchStepT(TwoLocalSearchContainer<CycleT>(m_cycle), std::move(ng), 
                                                 std::move(ich), TwoLocalSearchUpdater()),
                                                 m_cycle(solBegin, solEnd) {}
                     
                      TwoLocalSearchStep(Cycle<VertexType> c, 
                                         Metric & m, 
                                         ImproveChecker<Metric> ich,
                                         NeighborhoodGetter ng = NeighborhoodGetter()
                                         ) 
 
                        :   LocalSearchStepT(TwoLocalSearchContainer<CycleT>(m_cycle), std::move(ng), 
                                             std::move(ich), TwoLocalSearchUpdater()),
                                             m_cycle(std::move(c)) {}
                                      
         private:
            CycleT m_cycle;
};     
</pre>
</font>

Basic usage of this algorithm is extremely simple and elegant. <br> We are using some helper functions from the library.

<font size=4>
<pre>
      //assume that graph_t g is some graph from boost graph library

      typedef GraphMetric&ltgraph_t, int> GraphMT;
      GraphMT gm(g); // gm is a graph metric for graph g

      //create random solution <font color="red">// This is going to be contained in the library!</font>
      std::vector&ltint> ver = {A, B, C, D, E};
      std::random_shuffle(ver.begin(), ver.end()); 

      //creating of local search
      ImproveChecker2Opt&ltGraphMT> checker(gm);
      TwoLocalSearchStep&ltint, GraphMT> ls(ver.begin(), ver.end(), gm, checker);
      auto const & cman = ls.getSolution();

      //printing 
      std::cout << "Length " << simple_algo::getLength(gm, cman) << std::endl;
      simple_algo::print(cman, std::cout);

      //search
      ls.search();

      //printing after search
      simple_algo::print(cman, std::cout);
      std::cout << "Length " << simple_algo::getLength(gm, cman) << std::endl;

</pre>
</font>

Although the basic usage is very simple, the sophisticated user can still easily change default parameters and exchange them with his ones. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
