        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>The <strong>PAAL</strong> is an open source, a header-only, generic
        library consisting of approximation algorithms, data structures and
        several complete solutions for the various optimization problems. The
        <strong>PAAL</strong> is implemented taking advantage of the new features of <em>C++</em>
        introduced in the <em>C++14</em> standard, which in many cases simplify greatly
        creation of generic code.</p>

        <h1>Installation</h1>

        <p>There is no need to install anything because the
        <strong>PAAL</strong> is header only. All you have to do is download
        the library and include appropriate headers. Only, if you use linear
        programming you must link your executable against <em>glpk</em>.  If
        you'd like to alter the library, we encourage you to compile the unit
        tests.</p>

        <h1>Download</h1>

        <p>In order to download repository please run the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>git clone --recursive http://siekiera.mimuw.edu.pl:8082/paal</code></pre>

        <h1>General Design</h1>

        <p>The algorithms are written as template functions in STL-style. The
        major change is, that we support ranges instead of iterators. Usually
        algorithms can be customized or extended, as they support many
        different arguments. Besides, the algorithms, the library contains many
        useful data-structures. Our data structures introduce useful and
        interesting higher level concepts, e.g., Metric or Cycle.</p>

        <p>Besides standalone algorithms, the library contains frameworks which
        supports solving general optimization methods like local search or
        iterative rounding. The functional arguments of these frameworks are
        usually wrapped using <em>Components</em> class
        (see <a href="http://paal.mimuw.edu.pl/docs/comps.html"> Components</a>),
        which allows to specify named arguments. In such case the algorithm
        is called as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>algorithm(ProblemDescription, Components)</code></pre>

        <p>For each concept our library delivers the default implementations
        of components.  Of course the user is allowed to replace each
        component.  Consider for example the local search framework, where the
        user can can easily swap the implementation of the <em>GetMoves</em>
        procedure to provide his own way of searching the neighborhood.  Also
        note that the same components, that are used by local search can be
        used in the simulated annealing algorithm.  Similarly, if the user
        wants to swap the metric implementation to use specific properties of
        his topology, this is not a problem at all!</p>

        <h1>Platforms</h1>

        <p>Currently the library compiles on the gcc 4.8.1 and clang 3.5.
        Unfortunately, the library does not compile on the Microsoft Visual
        Studio 2013 due to its poor support of <i>C++14</i>.</p>

        <h1>License</h1>

        <p>The library is released under <a
            href="http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt">Boost Software
            License</a>
        , which encourages both commercial and non-commercial
        use.</p>
