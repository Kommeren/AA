        <h2>More Linear Programing Solvers</h2>
        <b>Brief explanation:</b>

            <p>Currently, we provide an interface for creating, modifying and
            (re)solving LP instances. As the underlying implementation we use
            the GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) library. Your work would be
            to add support for more sophisticated solvers:

            <ul>
                <li><a  href="http://gurobi.com"
                        target="_blank">Gurobi</a></li>
                <li><a
                        href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimization-studio/"
                        target="_blank">CPLEX</a></li>
            </ul>
            Subsequently, we plan to add support for <i>Integer Programming</i> into our framework.
            As hard as it sounds this
            task is relatively easy and we strongly believe, that it's more
            about coding than implementing complex algorithms this time. Except
            of having fun you will also learn how to use <i>LP</i> solvers and
            a lot about <i>discrete optimization</i>. For more information 

            <a href="http://paal.mimuw.edu.pl/docs/linear_programming.html" target="_blank">see</a>

            .
            </p>

        <b>Expected results:</b>

            <p>Interface for <i>Integer Programming</i> and support for other
            solvers, and documentation</p>
            

        <b>Knowledge prerequisite:</b> 
            <p>C++14, Doxygen</p>

        <b>Mentor:</b>
            <p>Piotr Wygocki</p>

        <h2>Guillotine Problem Approximation</h2>
        <b>Brief explanation:</b>

            <p>Recently our area of studies moved to family of
            
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem"
               target="_blank">multidimensional Bin Packing Problems</a>

           , especially since  we have come across new real world data from industry.
            It becomes clear that previous researchers focused on
            different problems, especially when it comes to

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillotine_problem"
               target="_blank">2D guillotine problems</a>
            
            . Recently, we developed novel approach, that relaxes certain constraints
            in this problem. We've created several prototypes that are using technique called

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_integer_programming"
                target="_blank">mixed integer programming</a>

            . We strongly believe that generic solution could save tons of materials in industry,
            hence we'd like to develop library solution for this problems. During this
            task you will have a lot of fun learning discrete optimization.</p>

        <b>Expected results:</b>

            <p>Library code that implements heuristic/exact algorithm for solving
            <i>Guillotine Problem</i>.</p>

        <b>Knowledge prerequisite:</b> 
            <p>C, C++, Linear Programming, Deep algorithmic knowledge, Discrete Optimization and a lot of communication.</p>
        <b>Mentor:</b>
            <p>Piotr Wygocki</p>

        <h2>Biddings for Python and Java</h2>
        <b>Brief explanation:</b>

            <p>The more people are using our Library the better. We belief that
            most of the people are not familiar with the newest C++, hence we want
            to facilitate using it for majority of programmers. This task aims
            to create interface similar to <i>numpy</i> or <i>scipy</i>,
            but we want to ensure that this biddings will be created
            automatically. We will not insist on any particular technology, but we
            require genuine generic solution and we will put pressure on creation of a comprehensive documentation.  
            This task will require deep knowledge of
            <i>C++14</i> and frequent communication.</p>

        <b>Expected results:</b>
            <p>Interface for using <b>PAAL</b>, in Python and Java.</p>

        <b>Knowledge prerequisite:</b> 
            <p>C, C++, Python, Java</p>

        <b>Mentor:</b>
            <p>Andrzej Pacuk</p>

        <h2>Recursive Neural Network</h2>
            <b>Brief explanation:</b>

            <p>Recursive neural networks are recent holy grail of machine learning.
            Problem with it though, is it's inefficiency. 
            Recently we have come into possession of <i>Intel Xeon Phi</i>
            and we do believe that implementation on this
            particular architecture will significantly increase it's speed and
            efficiency. Our goal is to create small machine learning tool program, that
            will assist programmers on <a href="http://kaggle.com"
            target="_blank">Kaggle</a> competitions, like <a href="http://hunch.net/~vw/" target="_blank">Vowpal Wabbit</a></p>

        <b>Expected results:</b>
            <p>Programming library for the newest <i>Intel Xeon Phi</i> cards.</p>
        <b>Knowledge prerequisite:</b> 
            <p>C, C++, Linux, OpenMP</p>
        <b>Mentor:</b>
            <p>Krzysztof Ciebiera</p>
