In the knapsack problem we are given set of objects and capacity of the knapsack. Each object has its size and value.
We should choose some objects of the total size not exceeding the capacity and maximizing the sum of the objects values.

There are to variants of this problem. In the standard Knapsack (which is called just Knapsack) problem, each objects can be chosen many times.
In the Knapsack 0/1 problem each object from the objects set can be chosen only once.
